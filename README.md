# The program that almost won me $10,000
This program almost won me $10,000, read on for more details.

A radio station had a competition running where if they played the same song twice in a day and you called up with the song name, you win $10,000. I set this program up to listen to the radio through a microphone, it then sends you an email if it hears the same song twice. After several days of debugging, I got it working nicely. Sure enough, the station played the same song twice, but becuase I had my phone on silent since I was concentrating at work, I missed the email with the correct song. Some guy called up and won (stole) my money. Covid 19 was raging at the time, as a result, there would have been a lot more people at home listening to the radio, which didn't help my cause. I had a lot of fun writing this program regardless.

I was limited by the song recognition API, it was not the most accurate, and was also expensive. I would have had to pay too much money to be able to make calls to the API as often as  I would have liked, as a result, the program did not provide a very fast response. It also was not very accurate, often recognising the wrong song. Below is the email that was sent to me with the winning song in bold. (Which is a terrible song for the record) You can see the first play was at 11:24 and the second play at 14:26.
